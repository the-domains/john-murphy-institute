Things I do on a snow day

I've got zero idea why certain pictures I post are winding up sideways. If anyone has any trouble shooting experience about this, please let me know. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1ae164c0-a45c-41b3-9f16-bb76f9dbee1e.JPG)

This ghastly fellow is made from scraps of my old clothes as well as abandoned sweat pants I found at the laundromat. I love repurposing fabric, after a thorough washing, of course. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/671197a8-4a5e-421f-ad24-075ebf122d26.JPG)
