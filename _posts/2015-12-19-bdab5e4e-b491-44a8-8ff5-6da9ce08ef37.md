# Things I do on a snow day

When I was snowed in from work for a solid two days, I made new monsters unimpeded by the work of being a counselor. It was heavenly. ![Smile!! or something](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ebc0bd0155445f5a925d02c41629460c936f64d3.jpg)

This ghastly fellow is made from scraps of my old clothes as well as abandoned sweat pants I found at the laundromat. I love repurposing fabric, after a thorough washing, of course. His teeth are foam rubber. Definitely NSFK (not safe for kids), a factor which increases risk for the kind of plush I create. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7bb50936d69959786551baeec7fe6a2c22d6b1b5.jpg)

I never did name this guy. But here he is with only one arm. I guess I couldn't wait to get him photographed!
