![The website, adventure and world formerly known as Stupid Creatures](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c2570dab-60dd-4f19-8ec6-51ff483b07bc.JPG)

Formerly known as Stupidcreatures.com, my new Institute for At-Risk Plush will be a place for learning, listening and making. I won't be selling any stuffed toys, at least, not as my mainstay, but I'll be posting patterns, tutorial videos, links to my books, and live classes. I'm learning some new software for designing my new website, so please bear with me as I make sense of it. While all this is going on, I will begin my master's degree studies for clinical mental health counseling so I can be more effective to the kids I serve in juvenile justice. Thanks for stopping by!
