Find all the books you'll need to make endless plush characaters at the links below. Most, when bought together from [Amazon][0], are significantly discounted. 

<article style=""><h1>John Murphy on Amazon</h1><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9069a3e0461b55caa511a84261149f7961eda673.jpg" /></article>

[Stupid Sock Creatures][1] was the first book written by the institute's director. The book has remained in print since 2005\. It contains 8 characters featuring an array of techniques that can be combined indefinitely to make new characters. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d0382192-3bf5-4116-8d7c-5c527a1f37ae.jpg)

[Closet Monsters][2] is not for wimps. Our director was approached by his publisher roughly a year into the ongoing success of Stupid Sock Creatures, and was asked to write a new book. Closet Monsters was the result. It features advanced, multi-step instructions for upcycling old clothing into stuffed monsters. It was during the life of this book when Director Murphy realized that the most vocal would-be crafters prefer easy, minimal projects that can be completed near-instantly with one hand while snapchatting and rolling one's eyes at one's mom. Closet Monsters, however, has been huge among dedicated, skilled craftspeople who love a challenge. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/079145b0-9a08-4c75-93d2-09cced312f62.jpg)

[Return of the Stupid Sock Creatures][3] crowns the Institute's core recommended reading. With readership from Stupid Sock Creatures going at a steady rumble, Director Murphy came to know many of his readers via emails, letters, forums and his actual mailbox. Readers the globe over sent and posted photos of their original characters created from the instructions from the first book. Return of the Stupid Sock Creatures features the works of the more outstanding and interesting readers, handpicked by Mr. Murphy to carry on the legacy of invention, reinvention, and resourcefulness. The opportunities for publication might not end here. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7819ca24-d058-4b34-b930-f2c8d79267e0.jpg)
