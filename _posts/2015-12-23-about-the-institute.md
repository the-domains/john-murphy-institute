# About the Institute
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e5d67bae-8dff-4e36-aff8-b3daced5408b.JPG)

John Murphy is an artist with a love for character design, comic strips and stuffed toys. 

John is also a counselor. He has worked with kids and teens in various states of mental health, circumstantial need and \[legal\] system involvement since 2007\. John hopes to combine his love for character design with his love for society's forgotten kids. 

The Institute for At-Risk Plush will start as a place for learning how to make stuffed toys. When John earns his counseling licensure, the Institute will begin to include arts based interventions for young people and families. 

Earning the credentials and learning the rules for offering professional counseling is a detailed process that cannot be rushed. In the meantime, as a published author, John has all the credentials he needs for teaching stuffed toy lessons. 

This website for now offers links to the books for learning John's techniques, and contact information. Videos, downloadable patterns and tutorials will be posted eventually. In the meantime, feel free to [email][0] suggestions and questions. 

This is going to be heaps of fun.
