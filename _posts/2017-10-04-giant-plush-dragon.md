  Look at me, everyone. I design for Land of Nod on the side. They started
  producing my stuff in 2011, and call me occasionally to do something else.
  This dragon was a surprise. I designed it for them roughly two years ago, and
  I was told it didn’t get the green light. But I suppose now’s the right time
  for it.

Look at me, everyone. I design for [Land of Nod][0] on the side. They started producing my stuff in 2011, and call me occasionally to do something else. This dragon was a surprise. I designed it for them roughly two years ago, and I was told it didn't get the green light. But I suppose now's the right time for it.

I like working with "Nod" because they tell me what they're interested in, and I submit heaps of sketches. They might say they want a line of plush robot toys, and I'll get to work on dozens of sketches of robot-like characters that I think can translate into plush. Then we narrow down the items over time and arrive at several that comprise the line. Sometimes they sell well, sometimes they do not. Toy design is a gamble, and everyone knows that. My aesthetic is often a bit strange and edgy, especially for nursery items, but Nod takes a chance on me, and I will be forever grateful.

Thanks, Nod, and may the dragon make us both very happy!!
