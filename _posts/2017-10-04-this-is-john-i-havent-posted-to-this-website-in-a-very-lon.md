I am testing to see how this looks. Right now I am torn between numerous options, one of which is my actual priority. I've got a paper due in a few days and I should work on it. Instead I'm tinkering with this website and its AI software (thank you, [Grid][0]). Some things about this software confuse me, but so far so good. We will see what happens.

I haven't posted to this website in a very long time, but for good reasons. At this very moment, I should be working on a paper, but an acquaintance of mine told me my website had no content when she tried to view it, so I'm trying to rectify that. At the moment, there isn't much content because I don't have my act entirely together. I'm roughly halfway through my graduate degree at Regent University for mental health counseling. With my full-time job in juvenile justice, there hasn't been much room for new art in the past several years. That will change when school is over and I work towards my counseling licensure. Here is what I plan to have more of on the website:

New art

Announcements for art lessons

Downloadable projects

My thoughts on mental health and human development

Classes and schedules

Discussion forums

Links to buy my books

All of this, of course, is contingent upon my learning this web design software. The Grid is meant to be easy. We shall see exactly how easy it is.
