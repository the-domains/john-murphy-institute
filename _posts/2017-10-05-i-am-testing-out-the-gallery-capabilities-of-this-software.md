# I am testing out the gallery capabilities of this [software][0].

The help page of The Grid tells me that to create a gallery, all one must do is upload at least nine images. Well here are twelve. We shall see the results.

These are images I used for an easy project I designed for [Craft Camp][1] (Lark Crafts, 2015).

What I like about this gallery feature is that all the images are condensed into one place. What I don't like is that when you click on an image, you're taken to a new page where the images are displayed together again. I would rather this software allow thumbnails and expanded images. I must see what can be done. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2166a702-e146-4484-bbbb-f5721c04bbc6.jpg)
