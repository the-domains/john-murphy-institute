This giant plush dragon may look ferocious, but you don&apos;t have to worry about it leveling any villages.</p></article>,<p>Look at me, everyone. I design for <a href="https://www.landofnod.com/giant-plush-dragon/s207609?st=john%20murphy" title="">Land of Nod</a> on the side. They started producing my stuff in 2011, and call me occasionally to do something else. This dragon was a surprise. I designed it for them roughly two years ago, and I was told it didn’t get the green light. But I suppose now’s the right time for it. </p>,<p>I like working with “Nod” because they tell me what they’re interested in, and I submit heaps of sketches. They might say they want a line of plush robot toys, and I’ll get to work on dozens of sketches of robot-like characters that I think can translate into plush. Then we narrow down the items over time and arrive at several that comprise the line. Sometimes they sell well, sometimes they do not. Toy design is a gamble, and everyone knows that. My aesthetic is often a bit strange and edgy, especially for nursery items, but Nod takes a chance on me, and I will be forever grateful. </p>,<p>Thanks, Nod, and may the dragon make us both very happy!!</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3b67e4ec-4b78-4260-a50c-2bfdda734969.jpg">,<p>This is John. I haven’t posted to this website in a very long time, but for good reasons. At this very moment, I should be working on a paper, but an acquaintance of mine told me my website had no content when she tried to view it, so I’m trying to rectify that. At the moment, there isn’t much content because I don’t have my act entirely together. I’m roughly halfway through my graduate degree at Regent University for mental health counseling. With my full-time job in juvenile justice, there hasn’t been much room for new art in the past several years. That will change when school is over and I work towards my counseling licensure. Here is what I plan to have more of on the website:</p>,<p>New art</p>,<p>Announcements for art lessons</p>,<p>Downloadable projects</p>,<p>My thoughts on mental health and human development</p>,<p>Classes and schedules</p>,<p>Discussion forums</p>,<p>Links to buy my books</p>,<p>All of this, of course, is contingent upon my learning this web design software. The Grid is meant to be easy. We shall see exactly how easy it is.</p>]]></description>
