            <description><![CDATA[<h1>BLARG</h1>,<p>October 12, 2017</p>,<p>Two of my <a href="https://www.landofnod.com/" title="">Land of Nod</a> dinosaur toys made it onto a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt7339922/?ref_=tt_eps_cu_n" title="Catch of the Day">recent episode of Modern Family</a>! Hulu subscribers can <a href="https://www.hulu.com/modern-family" title="Getcho ModFam On">see it</a> this week. If you look past <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0642145/?ref_=tt_cl_t1" title="Oh, Al!">Ed O’Neill</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7505356/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t12" title="How adorbs is he?">Jeremy Maguire</a> to the shelf at the far wall, you’ll see my orange triceratops. Just to the right of that is my giant blue stegosaurus on the floor. Al Bundy was in the SAME ROOM as MY TOYS. Sadly, these items are sold out as they were designed a couple of years ago. Maybe if enough of you <a href="https://www.landofnod.com/customer-service/contact-us" title="Please, Nod, Please?!">contact</a> Nod and ask nicely, they’ll bring ‘em back! Nothing to lose by trying!! Awfully sorry about the image quality too. Hulu might be particular about screen grabbing.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4e16d439-ebfd-444f-99d1-0314677322e7.png">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/43703923-5522-4438-8b1a-3d85b5d41bcf.png">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e6da7fab-5eba-4bc1-8210-f4c63e134317.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/90524880-ae4d-459e-8a68-ea0a35c06517.png">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0f6ed6e3-d9ba-40cd-b362-e7f1d6a3ae75.png">,<img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/e05007f38c3e37076d9c2af9f1dfbddd/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=1232&cropwidth=1801&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5ba04f37-ec38-4870-9545-bf6e161dfab1.jpg&x=0&y=57">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fc3f8a29-3de0-4b0a-b72a-fe7f54ab7030.png">]]></description>

He is currently earning his master’s degree in mental health counseling and trauma therapy, and plans to continue serving at-risk kids.</p>,<p>With studio life at a current ebb, John serves his state as a juvenile justice youth counselor, working with amazing, flawed, redeemable, chaotic, incredible, marvelous youngsters who add unspeakable dimension to his life, and change his perspective regularly.</p>,<p>What else..</p>,<p>John has 2 brothers and 2 sisters. He collects <a href="https://tfsource.com/" title="">transformers</a>. He has 3 nephews, one biological and two who adopted him. He has one goddaughter.

John loves to bake breads and sweets, and is said to have inherited that knack from his great grandfather. John likes to put faces on things. He loves to draw. And these days he cannot stop crocheting.</p>,<p>John is a redeemed sinner, and handles that ongoing process <a href="https://www.firstrpcdurham.org/" title="">here</a>.</p>,<p>His <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/YBGTYLJCP4GR/ref=nav_wishlist_lists_1" title="">birthday</a> is very soon ;)</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>I am testing out the gallery capabilities of this <a href="http://thegrid.io/" title="">software</a>.</h1>,<p>The help page of The Grid tells me that to create a gallery, all one must do is upload at least nine images. Well here are twelve. We shall see the results.</p>,<p>These are images I used for an easy project I designed for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Craft-Camp-Over-Projects-Kids/dp/1454709006/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507210887&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=lark+books+craft+camp" title="">Craft Camp</a> (Lark Crafts, 2015).</p>,<p>What I like about this gallery feature is that all the images are condensed into one place. What I don’t like is that when you click on an image, you’re taken to a new page where the images are displayed together again. I would rather this software allow thumbnails and expanded images. I must see what can be done. </p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2166a702-e146-4484-bbbb-f5721c04bbc6.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/09157a20-6917-4c89-8eb1-d16078202042.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/62802537-49d2-4b21-bfc2-b296c591f816.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9dcc5fb2-f843-4aef-906c-115f99caca38.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0c58a624-76c9-40b1-9c77-4911536aa672.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a667937a-a06e-4921-8f3b-cf2209d49c5a.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/666489c3-33ed-4c32-8ec0-826f899fa3ce.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b5a21c20-455c-4d1f-8d6f-4c9fd4edc44d.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2ff42fa2-f793-4d99-b51d-23cddde2c0e0.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/241a6257-ddd7-4125-9d3f-d7427bd96858.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e0e6589c-e741-481b-a9a7-5e3015c2413c.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9d2184bc-43a0-406f-a7e8-69f6b3072cb5.jpg">]]></description>
